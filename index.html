                <p>I'm a recent High School graduate determined to learn more about computer software and how it functions. I have an unhealthy obsession for pasta and crawfish, especially if they're combined. I have a cat named Caesar (as seen to the right) and he also has an unhealthy obsession for food. I wish to make video games someday and am a huge fan of old, retro-like games like Pokemon (my favorite being Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Sky made in 2009), Mario (my favorite being Super Mario Bros 3 made in 1988), Sonic (my favorite being the first Sonic Adventure in the series, which was also released in 1988), and more. I am also heavily inspired by the GameBoy and DS (mostly the GameBoy Advance SP and the DS Lite, which I own both momentarily) and hope to expand my knowledge of how that certain hardware works. My favorite color is orange but I hate the flavor of orange (how shocking). I really enjoy fall or winter, which has both of my favorite holidays; Halloween and Christmas.</p>

                <p>Oklahoma is my home; a land filled with cattle and interesting history. Oklahoma is stated as "a constituent state of the United States of America. It borders Colorado and Kansas to the north, Missouri and Arkansas to the east, Texas to the south and west, and New Mexico to the west of its Panhandle region."</p>
